# Analysis of Urban Form

These exploratory notebooks aim to establish a replicable workflow for studying urban form, starting with street networks.

## Introduction

The basic workflow is as follows:

1. Establish a clean set of measured geometry
2. Create graphs linking geometric elements
3. Analyse the geometries and graphs
4. Visualise the results

The stages are separated by the reading and writing of data to files.

## Real world entities

### Streets

### Junctions

## Representation as geometry

### Lines

#### Line segments

#### Line strings (polylines)

## Topological relationships (graphs)



Elementary notebooks dealing with geospatial issues, graphs and machine learning.
